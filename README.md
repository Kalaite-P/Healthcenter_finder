# SELF CARE👨‍⚕️👩‍⚕️

WE CARE! FOR YOUR HEALTH IS OUR CONCERN🧬🥼.

We all love to stay healthy and we hate getting sick🤢, but that's not always an option, we end up getting sick🤧 out of no-where and 
we need treatment🩺 sometimes it is very urgent to be treated immeadiately. And in this modern world we rely on medicine💊💊 and treatment
offered🔬💉 to get well and go back to our regular health😁.

In this project we get to experience having a finder / locator↕ ↔📌 on various health centres🏟 in our machines (Phones / Laptops
 / computers). It also provides information about professionals to help deal with stress and other challenges both mentally💆‍♂️💆‍♀️ and physically👩‍🦽👨‍🦯.
 It provides information about the health centers near you for immediate treatment and medical issues or problems🌡. This will assit people when new to a certain area
 or there are new health centres established thus creating health awareness🙋‍♂️🙋‍♀️ among people👨‍👩‍👧‍👦 and their location📍📍.
