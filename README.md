# SELFCARECENTER👨‍⚕️👩‍⚕️

WE CARE! FOR YOUR HEALTH IS OUR CONCERN.

We all love to stay healthy and we hate getting sick, but that's not always an option, we end up getting sick out of no-where and 
we need treatment sometimes it is very urgent to be treated immeadiately. And in this modern world we rely on medicine and treatment
offered to get well and go back to our regular health.

In this project we get to experience having a finder on various health centres in our machines (Phones / Laptops
 / computers). It provides information about the health centers near you for immeadiate treatment and medical issues or problems.
 
 You can find the project application [here](https://kalaite-p.github.io/SelfCareCenter_finder/).
