WE CARE! FOR YOUR HEALTH IS OUR CONCERN.
To collaborate with users in a repository that belongs to your personal account on GitHub.com, you can invite the users as collaborators.

If you want to grant more granular access to the repository, you can create a repository within an organization. For more information, see "Access permissions on GitHub."

Private forks inherit the permissions structure of the upstream repository. This helps owners of private repositories maintain control over their code. For example, if the upstream repository is private and gives read/write access to a team, then the same team will have read/write access to any forks of the private upstream repository. Only team permissions (not individual permissions) are inherited by private forks.

Inviting a collaborator to a personal repository.
You can send an invitation to collaborate in your repository directly to someone on GitHub.com, or to the person's email address

GitHub limits the number of people who can be invited to a repository within a 24-hour period. If you exceed this limit, either wait 24 hours or create an organization to collaborate with more people. For more information, see "Creating a new organization from scratch."
