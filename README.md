# SELF CARE👨‍⚕️👩‍⚕️

WE CARE! FOR YOUR HEALTH IS OUR CONCERN🧬🥼.

We all love to stay healthy and we hate getting sick🤢, but that's not always an option, we end up getting sick🤧 out of no-where and 
we need treatment🩺 sometimes it is very urgent to be treated immeadiately. And in this modern world we rely on medicine💊💊 and treatment
offered🔬💉 to get well and go back to our regular health😁.

In this project we get to experience having a finder / locator on various health centres🏟 in our machines (Phones / Laptops
 / computers). It provides information about the health centers near you for immeadiate treatment and medical issues or problems.
 
 You can find the project application [here](https://kalaite-p.github.io/SelfCareCenter_finder/).
